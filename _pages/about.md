I am Jiawei (Jerry) Li, an Technology Expert at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a>, doing research as one of the <a herf="https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html">TopMinds</a>, and also an External Supervisor for the <a href="https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)</a>, Tsinghua University, involved in guiding postgraduates. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Intern on Video Action Analysis, AIGC, and AI for Games at the Tencent TEG AI Lab and IEG Turing Lab, selected and supported by the <a href="https://ur.tencent.com/article/261">Tencent Rhino-bird Elite Training Program</a>.

I received my Bachelor’s degree from the <a href="http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/">School of Software, Chongqing University (CQU)</a> in 2015 and spent half year studying as an Exchange Student at the <a href="https://dcs.site.nthu.edu.tw/">Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Liu">Porf. Jane W.-S. Liu</a>. Then I continued to pursue my interests in the AI and CV fields, and earned my PhD degree in 2020 from the <a href="https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University (THU)</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm">Prof. Shu-Tao Xia</a>. During this time, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/">Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a> for a period.

My personal motto is “Don’t try to add more years to your life. Better add more life to your years.”, coming from Blaise Pascal. I read an more inspiring version of this quote from The Three-Body Problem, which is “Make time for civilization, for civilization won’t make time.”, written by Liu Cixin.
